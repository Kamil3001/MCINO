<h2>What is a Cyclomatic Complexity smell?</h2>
Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. It was developed by Thomas J. McCabe

<h2>How to treat?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If cyclomatic complexity exceeds 10, then the function needs to be broken up into smaller functions for simplification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improves understanding and organization of code.</li>
    <li>Reduces code size.</li>
</ul>
