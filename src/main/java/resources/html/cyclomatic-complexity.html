<h2>What is a Cyclomatic Complexity smell?</h2>
Cyclomatic complexity is a way of measuring the complexity of a program. This method was developed by Thomas J. McCabe.

<h2>How do we treat cyclomatic complexity?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If cyclomatic complexity exceeds a certain point, we then need to divide our functions into smaller ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do we bother fixing it?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improves the structure of code.</li>
    <li>Reduces number of lines in code.</li>
</ul>
