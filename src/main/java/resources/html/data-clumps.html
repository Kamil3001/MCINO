    <h2>What is a Data Clump smell?</h2>
    Data Clumps are a group of parameters that are passed around together.

    <h2>How to treat?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If repeating data comprises the fields of a class, use Extract Class to move the fields to their own class.</li>
        <li>If the same data clumps are passed in the parameters of methods, use Introduce Parameter Object to set them off as a class.</li>
        <li>If some of the data is passed to other methods, think about passing the entire data object to the method instead of just individual fields. Preserve Whole Object will help with this.</li>
        <li>Look at the code used by these fields. It may be a good idea to move this code to a data class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why bother?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves understanding and organization of code. Certain code is now gathered in the same place instead of being scattered everywhere in your program.</li>
        <li>Reduces code size</li>
    </ul>
