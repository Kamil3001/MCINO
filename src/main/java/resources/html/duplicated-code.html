    <h2>What is a Duplicated Code smell?</h2>
    When a program contains two code fragments which are identical.

    <h2>How to treat?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the same code is found in two or more methods in the same class: use Extract Method and place calls for the new method in both places.</li>
        <li>If the same code is found in two subclasses of the same level:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Extract Method for both classes, followed by Pull Up Field for the fields used in the method that you’re pulling up.</li>
            <li>If the duplicate code is inside a constructor, use Pull Up Constructor Body.</li>
            <li>If the duplicate code is similar but not completely identical, use Form Template Method.</li>
            <li>If two methods do the same thing but use different algorithms, select the best algorithm and apply Substitute </li>
        </ul>
        <li>If duplicate code is found in two different classes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If the classes aren’t part of a hierarchy, use Extract Superclass in order to create a single superclass for these classes that maintains all the previous functionality.</li>
            <li>If it’s difficult or impossible to create a superclass, use Extract Class in one class and use the new component in the other.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If a large number of conditional expressions are present and perform the same code (differing only in their conditions), merge these operators into a single condition using Consolidate Conditional Expression and use Extract Method to place the condition in a separate method with an easy-to-understand name.</li>
        <li>If the same code is performed in all branches of a conditional expression: place the identical code outside of the condition tree by using Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why bother?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplification + shortness = code that’s easier to simplify and cheaper to support.</li>
        <li>Merging duplicate code simplifies the structure of your code and makes it shorter.</li>
    </ul>
