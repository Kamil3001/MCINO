<h2>What is a Lazy Class smell?</h2>
When a class doesn't do enough, or doesn't do anything at all.


<h2>How to treat?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Components that are near-useless should be given the Inline Class treatment.</li>
    <li>For subclasses with few functions, try Collapse Hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced code size.</li>
    <li>Easier maintenance.</li>
</ul>
