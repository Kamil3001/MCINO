<h2>What is a Refused Bequest smell?</h2>
If a subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents, the hierarchy is off-kilter. The unneeded methods may simply go unused or be redefined and give off exceptions.

<h2>How to treat?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If inheritance makes no sense and the subclass really does have nothing in common with the superclass, eliminate inheritance in favor of Replace Inheritance with Delegation.</li>
    <li>If inheritance is appropriate, get rid of unneeded fields and methods in the subclass. Extract all fields and methods needed by the subclass from the parent class, put them in a new subclass, and set both classes to inherit from it (Extract Superclass).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improves code clarity and organization. You will no longer have to wonder why the Dog class is inherited from the Chair class (even though they both have 4 legs).</li>
</ul>
