<h2>What is a Refused Bequest smell?</h2>
If a subclass only uses some of the methods from the superclass, the methods that are not used may lead to exceptions.

<h2>How can we treat this problem?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Inheritance is useful but not in all cases. If a lot of methods are unused maybe replace inheritance with delegation.</li>
    <li>If inheritance is the most efficient way to go, get rid of unused methods and create an Extract class for those methods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Makes code more legible and easier to understand. Reduces ambiguity and makes sure subclasses pass the 'is a' test for inheritance.</li>
</ul>
